# ICONS GW
The internet connection server gateway. This is installed on a machine that has access to an IP sub network. This subnetwork will have yView devices sitting on it. A yView device is any device that responds to a yView are you there (AYT) message. In order to use the icons_gw you should have previously started the [icon server](https://github.com/pjaos/icons).


# Building
You will need pipx and poetry installed on your machine to build the python wheel. Once you have done this run the build.sh script and the python wheel file will be created in the local dist folder.

E.G

```
ls dist
icons_gw-5.0.0-py3-none-any.whl  icons_gw-5.0.0.tar.gz
```

# Installation

# Configuration
Run the `icons_gw --config' command. You will be prompted to enter a number of parameters as detailed below.

- `The ICON server (ICONS) address`
This is address (IP address or domain name) of the icon server over the internet. Typically this will be you routers IP address as provided via DHCP from you ISP. You may wish to setup a DDNS if you ISP does not provide a static IP address. In this case you'll need a DNS domain name to link your router IP address too.

- `The ICON server TCP IP port`
The TCP/IP port to connect to the icon server. By default this is 22 but it is recommended that this is changed from the default.

- `The ICONS username`
The ssh username on the icon server.

- `The location name for this ICONS destination client`
This location is used to identify the location (subnetwork) that the icons_gw is running (E.G HOME).

- `The local ssh private key file to use when connecting to the ICONS`
By default your local private ssh key file should be displayed but you may change this to other local private keys that you have. If you have no local private/public key pairs then use the `ssh-keygen -t RSA` command to generate a default pair of keys.

# Starting the icons_gw for the first time
Once configured open a terminal window and enter `icons_gw`. You will be prompted for the password of the ssh server. On successful connection to the ssh server your local ssh public key will be copied to the icons server. Once this is successfully completed will not need to enter your password again.

Enter the `icons_gw` command again and a successful connection to the icon server should be made.

Once connected, details of the local (to the sub network) yView devices will be forwarded to the icon server.
